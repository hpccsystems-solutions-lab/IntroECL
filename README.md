# IntroECL
Welcome to the Repository of the new Introduction to ECL Mini Course

This repo is designed to be used with the GitPods Interface.

In the Data folder contains two smaller versions of our Persons and Accounts files used in the Full Course. It is reduced so that you can quickly download and spray into your local VM cluster (localhost).

The idea is to continue to learn the ECL query and transformation examples in the repo but just using a smaller dataset.

The expected solutions are contained in the PDF included in te docs folder.

Test..  Another Test

Happy coding!!!
