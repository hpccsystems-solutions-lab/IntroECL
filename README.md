# IntroECL
Welcome to the Repository of the new Introduction to ECL Mini Course

## Getting Started

This repo is designed to be used with the GitPods Interface. The link to launching GitPods is here:

[Launch IntroECL Mini Course in GitPods](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/hpccsystems-solutions-lab/IntroECL)

GitPods requires that you have a GitHub account. The first time you launch GitPods there will be initial authorization and verification. You only have to do this once.
The first time GitPods launches, an image needs to be created. Please be patient as this might take a few minutes based on your hardware and internet connection.

A short video on launching GitPods and starting the course can be found here:

## Caveats
At the time of this launch a free GitPods account is 50 hours a month. It is not an open source product and more time per month requires a subscription.

The GitPods instance that you launch is NOT persistent. In order to make the most of your time, a smaller version of our training datasets is located in the repo Data folder.

In the Data folder contains two smaller versions of our Persons and Accounts files used in the Full Course. It is reduced so that you can quickly download and spray into your local VM cluster (localhost).

The idea is to continue to learn the ECL query and transformation examples in the repo but just using a smaller dataset.

The expected solutions are contained in the PDF included in the **CoursePDF** folder.

In the Code folder, the code is ready to run after your data has been sprayed. In addition, there is an Examples folder that is ready to run and does not require a sprayed dataset (similar to the ECL Playground).

Happy coding!!!
